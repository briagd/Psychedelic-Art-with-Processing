![Picture of render](https://github.com/briagd/Psychedelic-Art-with-Processing/blob/master/psych-000006.png)<br/>

A short program showing how some psychedelic art can be created using Processing and some trig functions.<br/>
This work is inspired by [Jeremy Kun's Random (Psychedelic) Art](https://jeremykun.com/2012/01/01/random-psychedelic-art/).<br/>
<br/>
Each time the progam is run a different pattern will appear. <br/>
It is possible to save each frame as a picture and then use processing movie maker to make a video.<br/>
If the pixel size is 1, then it will take some time to run on large canvas size.
